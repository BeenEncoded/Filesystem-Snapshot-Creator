Snapshot Program will be designed to allow the user
to take a snapshot of their filesystem and keep records of
the changes that were made.

Made to use with:

Netbeans (optional)

Compiled with MinGW and the Boost Library.

*********************************************************

Also, I realize that the time class is really cruddy and I plan to re-write it in the future, but I really need this program up and running
for personal reasons.

I do write classes to re-use in multiple projects (like the boost_iter class, and the time class), so if you find somthing wrong, please let me know!  :)

**NOTICE:  This project is being scrapped for a more updated re-write for Linux that will**
**take advantage of multi-threading and be much more efficient.**
